# Data Structures API CI/CD integration examples

This repository serves as a simple example of integrating Data Structures API into a typical CI/CD workflow. 

## Overview

In the [app](app) directory you can find a basic HTML/JS page embedding the [Snowplow Javascript Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-javascript-tracker),
while in the repo's root a file called [snowplow-schemas.json](snowplow-schemas.json) describes the schema dependencies for the app.  

Such file will be parsed, validated and used by Data Structures CI in a pipeline step to check that each schema is 
correctly deployed to the proper environment, before the code for the app gets deployed, effectively guarding against a major
source of Failed Events.

## Manifest validation
The [snowplow-schemas.json](snowplow-schemas.json) file, which is intended to be kept in sync with the source code by declaring and keeping updated the app's schema dependencies,
will be validated against the following [Self Describing JSON Schema](https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2014/05/15/introducing-self-describing-jsons/#sdjs): 
http://iglucentral.com/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.insights/data_structures_dependencies/jsonschema/1-0-0

## CI/CD setup
This repo also features two CI/CD pipelines: one based on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) (configured by [.travis.yml](.travis.yml)) 
and one based on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (configured by [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci-yml))
This is for demonstrational purpose only: typically the developers maintaining a repository will choose only one CI/CD solution.

In this case, the GitHub Action workflow serves as a demonstration for the [Data Structures CI Github Action](https://github.com/snowplow-product/msc-schema-ci-action),
while the Travis CI pipeline serves as a universal example for non-GitHub CI/CD solutions.

### GitHub Actions
The GitHub Actions workflow setup consists in adding the [Data Structures CI Github Action](https://github.com/snowplow-product/msc-schema-ci-action) as a step of a job.
See [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for an example and the Action's repo for reference and configuration.

### Universal (e.g. Travis CI, CircleCI, Gitlab, Azure Pipelines, Jenkins...)
The universal/generic approach (for non-GitHub CI/CD solutions) is based on an executable Java artifact (JAR) which can be run directly as a CLI application.
See [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) for an example
